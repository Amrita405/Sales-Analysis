# Sales-Analysis

This is a mini-project which particularly has helped me have hand-on experience for use of pandas and data visualization using matplotlib in python for data science related experience. Here, I have worked on the 12 months sales data of a company and tried to answer some questions which can be useful for the analysis of the data. Following is the outform of the tasks accomplished:

#Importing essential libraries

#Merging 12 months of slaes data into one file

#Cleaning up the data

#Augmenting data with additional columns

Following are the questions answered:

1.) Which was the best month of sale?How much was earned that month?
    With the help of data visualization (the bar plot between month number and sales), 12th month had the best sale with earning of $4613443.

2.) Which city has the highest number of sales?
    San Francisco( CA ) had the highest number of sales with the amount of $8262204.
    
3.) What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of buying products?
    Graph recommends around 11am and 7pm and the highest sale time. So. this time seems better to display advertisements.
    
4.) What products are often sold together?
    Here, we obatined a 7136 rows Ã— 2 columns table which diplayed the combinations of products which were often sold together.
    
5.) What product was sold the most?
    AAA Batteries (4-pack) seemed to be sold the most.
